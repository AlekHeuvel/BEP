\chapter{2-Dimensional model}
\label{chapter:2-Dimensional}

1-dimensional models, while easy to work with, do not always give a correct physical description. We expand on the 1-dimensional model by allowing electrons to move both in the $x$ and $y$ direction. Later, we will expand to a model where the electrons can also move in the positive $z$ direction.

Since we have already been using vector notation, adding another dimension won't prove very difficult. Following the same steps as in section \ref{section: Vector Notation}, we take an external electric field
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E_\text{ext}} = 
    \begin{pmatrix*}
        E_\text{ext} \sin(\theta_\text{ext}) \cos{\phi_\text{ext}} \\
        E_\text{ext} \sin(\theta_\text{ext}) \sin{\phi \text{ext}}\\
        E_\text{ext} \cos(\theta_\text{ext})
    \end{pmatrix*}
\end{equation}
